Welcome to my website !      
I'm your friendly console Qbie,
I'm working on amelioring myself 
I'll be able to do a lot of things in the future to help you interacts with the projects here
My master will learn soon enough how to make me dialog with you 

The purpose of this website is to sort some of my projects and show some fun visualisation
I'm currently challenging myself to upload at least one project per day to this website

I have some issues with my homepage, i'll fix it later

some of my function aren't working on the Homepage (i dont know why)

to test them copy :
run https://ksludovic.github.io/website/Terminal/index.html

I'll add a speak function to my console so you can speak with Qbie :)


I hope you'll enjoy your stay.
