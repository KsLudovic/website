I'm currently rank 1k2~ worldwide, and recently hit a Legend Ranking !
I'm currently searching for a team for the Fall challenge that will occur
this year.

As an algorithm enthusiast, one of my dream, is to make 
"hard algorithm principle"
easy to learn, via some simple and fun visualization !

I know my HomePage is quiet broken right now, i'll fix it

I'll soon use Angular Framework form this website, but i'm already
working on a lot of projects at the same time, so it'll take time,

I'm currently Searching for an InternShip, do not hesitate to contact me
via my mail.

If you are interested in some of my works, or want to work with me on improving
some ideas, i'll really enjoy it.

I know a lot of my projects feels a bit short on explanation, 
these as first was only done for myself, and keeping track of them.

I hope you'll enjoy your stay, and maybe learn some fun things.

Thanks,
C.Ludovic
