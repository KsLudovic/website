I know there is an issue, i need to add github shortcut to each of my "project card"

Text contains some typing error, sorry, will fix it soon

This website work as a template of some of my projects

Most of these projects were done recently, i'm imposing to myself a  "one project a day challenge" 


All visualisation of these app are in my website.

The contact form of the website doesn't work as attended yet, to contact me please email me :

I know its not optimal for a website to have that many working projects, but i though that was nice to have an easy way to have visualisation over these projects
